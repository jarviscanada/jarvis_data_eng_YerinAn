# Introduction
(about 150-200 words)
Discuss the design of the project. What does this project/product do? Who are the users? What are the technolgoies you have used? (e.g. bash, docker, git, etc..)

# Quick Start
Use markdown code block for your quick start commands
- Start a psql instance using psql_docker_01.sh create/start/stop/remove/check
- Create tables using psql -h localhost -U postgres -d host_agent -f sql/ddl.sql
- Insert hardware specs data into the db using host_info.sh psql_host port
- Insert hardware usage data into the db using host_usage.sh
- Crontab setup

# Implemenation
Discuss how you implement the project.
## Architecture
Draw a cluster diagram with three Linux hosts, a DB, and agents (use draw.io website). Image must be saved to `assets` directory.

## Scripts
Shell script descirption and usage (use markdown code block for script usage)
1. psql_docker.sh
   1. DESCRIPTION : depending on the command, run a shell script.
   1. COMMAND     : command='create' 'start' 'stop' 'remove' 'check'
   1. HOW TO RUN  : bash psql_docker.sh start password yerin
1. host_info.sh
   1. DESCRIPTION : checking the table exists or not, and adding a row
   1. HOW TO RUN  : bash host_info.sh localhost 5432 host_agent postgres password run
1. host_usage.sh
   1. DESCRIPTION : checking the table exists or not, and adding a row
   1. HOW TO RUN  : bash host_usage.sh localhost 5432 host_agent postgres password run

## Database Modeling
Describe the schema of each table using markdown table syntax (do not put any sql code)
- `host_info`
- `host_usage`
- `ddl`
- `queries`
* host_info
id | hostname | cpu_number | cpu_architecture | cpu_model | cpu_mhz | L2_cache | total_mem | time_ 
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
1 | hostname | 1 | x86_64 | Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.30GHz | 2300.000 | 256 | 751324 | '2021-03-16 16:58:58' 

* host_usage
time_ | host_id | memory_free | cpu_idle | cpu_kernel | disk_io | disk_available
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------

# Test
How did you test your bash scripts and SQL queries? What was the result?
- `host_info` : set up the information about host information and add a row.
- `host_usage`: set up the information about host usage and add a row.
- `ddl`       : create tables which are host_info, and host_usage.
- `queries`   : able to run some queries
                (Total memory info, Average memory usage, Detect host failure) 
                and show the results.
# Improvements
Write at least three things you want to improve 
- create exception handler.
- write explanations for all functions.
- create a file to run all functions at once.
