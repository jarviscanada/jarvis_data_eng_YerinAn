# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am currently a Software and Data Engineer with Jarvis and graduate from Centennial College with an Advanced Diploma of Software Engineering Technology. I have always been passionate about new technology and thinking of integrating technology into our daily lives. And it gives me to motivate and learn that can improve myself. I'm currently a Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting, where I am being given the opportunity to apply my knowledge and hone my skills with industry-standard tools such as Java, SQL, Springboot, Hadoop, Spark, and Cloud DevOps. Also, I have experience as a back-end developer for around a year, and I worked as a web developer with a co-op program. During that time, I worked with REST APIs, data analytics, and application development, and these experiences helped me become a team-oriented, detail-oriented, and responsible person. I am looking forward to working in data engineering and getting a chance to contribute to the innovations.
